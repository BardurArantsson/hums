-- Reduce the amount of printf'ing drastically!

-- Get rid of the silly Parsec dependency...

-- Use Blaze.Builder/"xml-enumerator" to build XML output instead
   of HaXML?

-- Switch to using "filemanip" System.FilePath.Find instead of
  hand-rolled directory traversal...? MTL dependency could be a problem...

-- Object.hs/scanFile: Should handle 'file gone missing' -- simply
   don't prepend an object in that case.

-- DirectoryUtils: walkTree should detect loops (via symlinks or "circular mount" structures).

-- Change the "dynamic/services/%s/control" bits of Service.hs to a common
  function which can be used to also generate the routes.
